# pipelineOdooToPostgresDW
This repository connects to an Odoo instance, retrieves data, and replicates it into a PostgreSQL data warehouse for analytics and reporting. Utilizing Odoo's XML-RPC and REST APIs, it ensures seamless data extraction and synchronization. Suitable for on-premises or cloud deployments, it offers secure and scalable data handling.
### General Steps to Set Up Each Project
Database Setup: Execute the SQL scripts in the sql/create_tables/ folder to set up the necessary tables in your PostgreSQL database.

Airflow Setup: Set up Apache Airflow on your machine or server. Place the DAG files in the dags/ directory of your Airflow setup.

Dependency Installation: Install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt using pip:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Pipeline: Once everything is set up, start the Airflow scheduler and web server to monitor the execution of your ETL pipelines.

SQL Views: After the data is loaded into PostgreSQL, run the SQL scripts in the sql/views/ folder to create complex views for analytics.

### Additional Notes
Modularization: The scripts are modular, making it easy to update or add new tables and transformations without affecting the entire pipeline.

Advanced SQL: The complex SQL views leverage advanced SQL techniques like CTEs, window functions, and subqueries to provide insightful analytics.

Scalability: This structure allows for easy scaling, adding more tables or modifying the DAGs as needed.

By following this structure, you can create scalable, maintainable, and powerful ETL pipelines using Apache Airflow, while also enabling complex analytics through advanced SQL views.
